## DATA SCIENCE

#### Solar Power Generation in Europe : Kaggle part [1](https://www.kaggle.com/obrunet/clustering-part-1-3) - [2](https://www.kaggle.com/obrunet/exploratory-data-analysis-part-2-3) - [3](https://www.kaggle.com/obrunet/solar-generation-forecast-part-3-3) - Notebook part [1](https://github.com/obrunet/Kaggle_kernels_2020/blob/master/Solar%20power%20generation/02.POC.01_Solar_Clustering.ipynb) - [2](https://github.com/obrunet/Kaggle_kernels_2020/blob/master/Solar%20power%20generation/02.POC.02_Solar_EDA.ipynb) - [3](https://github.com/obrunet/Kaggle_kernels_2020/blob/master/Solar%20power%20generation/02.POC.03_Solar_Predictions.ipynb)
* Use case: countries segmentation depending on their generation profile, power plant's efficiency prediction accross time 
* Data: hourly estimates of an area's energy potential for 1986-2015 as a percentage of a power plant's maximum output
* Concepts: __unsupervised__ ML (__KMeans Clustering__), basics statistics for the exploratory data analysi, other supervised M.L classical models, use of __Facebook's lib prophet__ for time series, __deep learning : R.N.N__ and more.
